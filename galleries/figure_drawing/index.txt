Years ago I enjoyed drawing with a pencil or charcoals on paper. I would go to an artist's studio in Soho called `Spring Street Studio <http://springstudiosoho.com/>`_ where I would take figure drawing classes. I enjoyed my time there very much. Below are some photographs of my drawings.

I haven't been there in years. I miss it and would like to go back one day.
