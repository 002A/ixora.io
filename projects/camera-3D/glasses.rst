.. type: text

I have a collection of 3D Glasses for viewing Anaglyphs that I've purchased through Amazon.com. Here they are, with comments.

Anaglyphs can be made with a large variety of `color filtering strategies <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_3D#Anaglyphic_color_channels>`_. If you know of a reasonable way to purchase different types of glasses that are not listed here, do let me know.

**Red-Cyan**

* `Pro-Ana (TM) PROFESSIONAL 3D Glasses <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VU0S7M>`_

  I use these glasses more than any of the others. The red/cyan lenses filter colors better than the cheaper cardboard glasses, resulting in a better image. If you are going to work on an anaglyph project for any length of time, buy a pair of these.

  These glasses took over a month to arrive and they didn't look like the glasses shown (accurate picture `here <http://www.amazon.com/Red-blue-Anaglyph-3D-Glasses-game-Extra/dp/B003LWYGPE/>`_). Since identical glasses are available elsewhere on the site, I recommend buying one of the other copies instead.

* `50 Pairs - 3D Glasses Red and Cyan <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009TZRIGG>`_

  Inexpensive 3D glasses that arrive individually wrapped that you can give out to a large group of people. I bought these for when I taught at ITP Camp. They don't work quite as well as the non-cardboard ones, so for design and development work, buy a better pair. For an exhibition of some kind, these would be a great choice.

**Green-Magenta**

* `Pro-X Style Magenta/Green 3D Glasses <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036F0Y2U>`_
  
  The lenses on these don't filter colors nearly as well as any other glasses I've tried. If you are curious about anaglyphs and want to buy one of `every possible pair of glasses <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_3D#Anaglyphic_color_channels>`__ like I do, give it a try. Otherwise, don't bother.

**Amber-Blue (ColorCode 3D)**

* `3D Video Wizard 3D Glasses <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005SN3IN0>`_
  
  `ColorCode 3D <http://ogon3d.com/colorcode3d.htm>`_ is a relatively new technology for creating anaglyphs that produces results that are superior to red-cyan anaglyphs. The range of colors you can see is quite impressive.

  `3D Wizard <http://www.amazon.com/Video-Wizard-Console-Adult-Glasses/dp/B005SN3INA>`_  is some electronics device that converts 3D content into something viewable on a 2D TV, but that isn't important here. The glasses themselves work quite well for creating amber-blue anaglyphs with Camera3D.

  These glasses are great but they are narrower than the others and might be uncomfortable if you have an extra large cranium.

* `ColorCode (TM) 3D Glasses (3 Pairs) <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ROY6GW>`_

  Cardboard amber-blue glasses. They work well but will not be as durable as the plastic ones above. If you know of a place to buy these in large quantities, please let me know.
