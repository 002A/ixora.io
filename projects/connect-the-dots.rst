One of my first Processing_ projects was a series of connect the dots style animations, like this:
    
.. vimeo:: 83177140
  :height: 360
  :width: 506

As the project grew I also made printable designs. I used these designs for the covers of my holiday cards and the back of my personal cards.

To facilitate the work positioning the dots, I built an Inkscape extension in Python. It extracts path information from the SVG file and creates the correct input file for my Processing program. Using this tool, I can make new designs in an hour or two.

The animations can be found on Vimeo.
