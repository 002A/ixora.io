I've always been fascinated by VFX, so I very much enjoyed learning about After Effects in my Animation class. I spent more time on this project than anything else this semester.

My project was inspired by this popular online video shown in class:

I liked the simulacra video so I figured out how to recreate it. I did this by making heavy use of After Effects' Camera Tracker to position JPG images of individual frames of the movie into 3D space. Each JPG image is positioned in time and space in such a way that it seamlessly blends in with the rest of the animation. To work correctly the positioning must be done with great precision. To make that happen I used After Effects ExtendScript to do the necessary calculations and other automation tasks.

The code is available online at `github <https://gist.github.com/hx2A/a336f95469ac154c102e8fcc7167bb6a>`_. For more information about the math and other details about this project, please look at my `class blog post <link://slug/the-halls-of-itp>`_.
