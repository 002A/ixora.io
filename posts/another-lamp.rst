.. type: text

I made another lamp; this time, out of an empty wine bottle.

Similar design and build as `the first one <link://slug/i-made-a-lamp>`_, made with leftover gravel. The lampshade is the same color and fabric, so they're an matching set! 

Someday I'll probably make third one and give it away.
