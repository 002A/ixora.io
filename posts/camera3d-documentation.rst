This past week I spent much of my time writing the documentation for my latest project, `Camera-3D <link://section_index/projects/camera-3D>`_. This is an open source library for Processing_. It will enable artists and creative technologists to transform their sketches into 3D anaglyphs and experiment with other 3D effects.

Once I finish the examples this will be ready to go live. I am so excited!
