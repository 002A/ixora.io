.. description: Piano solos on recently tuned piano
.. type: text

Recently I got my piano tuned and I re-recorded myself playing a few songs.

Here is Pachelbel's Canon in D. I played this at my brother's wedding in a few weeks ago. I didn't play it as well as I do here but I did my best. It's hard playing in front of people!

Next is Erik Satie's Gnossienne #3. One of my favorites. Right now I am trying to commit it to memory.

And finally, Frederic Chopin's Prelude in C Minor #20. This yielded my first ever Youtube comment!
