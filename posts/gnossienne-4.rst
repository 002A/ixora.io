It's been a while since I posted something here.

In January and February I was a data science fellow at `The Data Incubator <https://www.thedataincubator.com/>`__ and worked very, very hard on projects and assignments to learn more about Python and data science tools. But now that that's over, I have time for other things.

I fixed my laptop and can now record videos of myself playing piano again. Here's Erik Satie's Gnossienne #4:

I made a few minor mistakes here and there but overall I am very happy about it. The broken cords make this a difficult piece to play.

More to come. Next I am going to change the theme of this website. Stay tuned...
