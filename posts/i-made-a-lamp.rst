.. type: text

I made a lamp out of an empty olive oil bottle.

After removing the label and cleaning it out, I drilled a hole near the bottom using diamond drill bits and a press drill. The electric cord runs through the center of the bottle up to the opening on top.

The bottle is filled with fish tank gravel. It was very hard getting it in the bottle! I tried using a funnel but it kept getting clogged. Eventually I settled on dumping it in the mouth by hand with the bottle in a large bin to catch the many rock pieces that did not go inside. This took some time.

The mauve lamp shade is made of silk. I think it matches the gravel quite well.

I also made that coaster sitting on the nightstand. That was a long time ago though.
