A new version of Camera3D has been released!

Version 1.2 supports 360 videos. Here is an example:

.. vimeo:: 216711676
  :height: 300
  :width: 600

In addition, I made some performance improvements using new tools found in Java 1.8. Processing 2.x is no longer supported.

More information available on the `Camera-3D <link://section_index/projects/camera-3D>`_ Project page.
