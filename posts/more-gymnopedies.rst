.. description: Piano solo: Satie's Gymnopedies
.. type: text

I've been putting a lot of effort into learning the first three of Satie's Gymnopedies. Here's me playing the second one:

I also tried playing all three in  a row. I noticeably messed up the chords in a few places but I'm posting it anyway.

When I listen to the professionals play Satie's songs the chords are played softer than the way I hit them. I tried to imitate them here, but made more mistakes as a result.
