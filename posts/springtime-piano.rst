.. description: Piano solo: Erik Satie's Gymnopedie #1
.. type: text

I made some videos of myself playing piano.

The first is Erik Satie's Gymnopedie #1. The perfect song for springtime. I think I play well here but I hesitate in a couple of places. Still trying to learn all the chords.

Next is Frederic Chopin's Prelude in C Minor #20. This is often called the "Funeral March." Not for Springtime, but a beautiful piece nevertheless.
