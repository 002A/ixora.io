Here's a somewhat clumsy rendition of Erik Satie's Nocturne #1. I botched one measure towards the end but besides that I hit all the right notes.

I put together my own version of the `sheet music <http://ixora.io/downloads/sheet-music/erik_satie_nocturne_1.pdf>`_ in MuseScore because I couldn't find a version I liked without notation errors. Also, I wanted to learn MuseScore.
