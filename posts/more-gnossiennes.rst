.. description: Piano solo: Gnossienne #1
.. type: text

I play my favorite song Gnossienne #1 so often that I can play it from memory. I've been able to play it from memory for a few months now, but I didn't attempt to make a video of myself without sheet music until today.

I think I play it much better here. I am more gentle with the chords, which is important for Satie's work.

And I can now play Gnossienne #2 reasonably well. This still a work in progress.

I have started on #3, and can play the first third of the piece.
