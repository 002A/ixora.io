Here's an improved rendition of Pachelbel's Canon in D. This time I used the pedal and didn't speed up as I approached the crescendo. I made one or two mistakes but they are relatively minor.

And I also recorded this on the first try, without sheet music! The previous recording took 20 attempts.

There's also a new connect the dots puzzle available, depicting a `Pterodactyl </downloads/connect-the-dots/pterodactyl.pdf>`_.
