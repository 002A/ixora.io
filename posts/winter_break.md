My first semester at ITP is complete, and I enjoyed it very much. The workload was intense but that never bothered me. Every day I got out of bed excited for the things I would do that day.

Currently I am making improvements to this website. I made many enhancements to the style sheets and added a logo to the side menu. I also wrote extra documentation that I didn't have time for during the semester.

Before the next semester starts I hope to move the hosting from github to S3. If I have time, I'll add a P5 animation to the homepage.
