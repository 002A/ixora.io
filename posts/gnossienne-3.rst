.. description: Piano solo: Erik Satie's Gnossienne #3
.. type: text

I finally had time to record myself playing Erik Satie's Gnossienne No. 3. There are 6 of them, but I am just going to focus on the first 3 for now.

This isn't my best rendition of this piece but it will do. I need to record myself more often so I get more comfortable with it. I should also re-record the pieces in my previous posts because I can play those much better now.

Currently I am working on Satie's Nocturnes No. 1 and Robert Shumann's Tr√§umerei.
