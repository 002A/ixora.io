My :doc:`mouse-tracings` project has been added to the projects page. I collected data on keyboard and mouse activity for many months and used the data to create colorful images. Go to the `gallery </galleries/mouse_tracings/>`_ to see the endless beauty of data and the :doc:`project page<mouse-tracings>` to learn how they were made.
