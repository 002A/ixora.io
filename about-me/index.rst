.. description: Description of who I am and what this website is about.
.. type: text

I am a graduate student at `ITP <https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp>`_, a department within the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU. ITP students are a bright and motivated bunch who are interested in the exploration of creative applications of technology. I am excited and grateful to be a part of this community.

My primary interests focus on computer graphics and machine learning. I also want to learn about physical computing, electronics, and 3D-fabrication. Most of my technical experience centers on computer programming and data analysis. I would like to leverage my analytical abilities to branch out to new fields and tools.

I'm full of ideas and can't wait to bring them to life.
