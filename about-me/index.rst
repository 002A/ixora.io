My name is Jim, and this is my website.

I put this together so I could share my creative efforts and projects. Sometimes these things would be unknown to the world, and that's a shame. Creativity is important to me, and I would like for you to see that.

When I think of creativity, it doesn't just mean activities like drawing a picture or playing a song on my piano. It also includes data science and data analysis. Neither can exist without creativity and ingenuity. When I am studying data, I feel like I am using the same part of my brain as when I am doing more typical creative activities.

In my head, there isn't a clear separation between what people consider art and what people consider analytics. At my job I must pay attention to such things, but here, I am going to do what inspires me. Whatever that happens to be.
