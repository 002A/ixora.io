.. description: Stop Motion: Apple Tree
.. type: text

Our first group project is to create a short stop motion animation using Dragonframe. We created a short story about an apple tree.

This video is hilarious and cracks me up every time I watch it. This was a lot of fun to make.

No, that is not my finger.

I also filmed a short stop motion animation for my 3D printing class. We learned about Dragonframe in this class a few days earlier and I put it to good use right away.

Clearly the key to stop motion filming is having a detailed plan of what is going to happen and how. I thought it would be tedious and stressful filming something one picture at a time, but I found that with the right preparation the actual filming was much less stressful than I expected.
