After Effects
=============

We started learning about Adobe After Effects, a video editing and compositing tool that I enjoy immensely. I spent more time than I should have going through After Effects tutorials and learning about what this tool can do. This tool is super useful; there were many moments when I realized that some cool thing I've seen can be easily done with After Effects. I want to become proficient at this and use it for creative work.

We were asked to build a short composition with animated shapes but I got carried away building an animated character that walks across the screen. The character is built in Illustrator and animated in After Effects. I added some sound effects using Premiere. Enjoy!

The character's legs are animated with rotating null objects that have carefully chosen anchor points. The pairs of legs rotate around the null objects at the same speed but in the opposite direction.

This could easily be expanded to a longer animation that features the same character walking across the screen and pausing to interact with its environment or other characters. I will consider this for our project due in a few weeks.

I also experimented with special effects, including image stabilization and camera tracking. Camera tracking is great and is essential for adding 3D objects to video. I recorded some footage with my phone using a camera stabilizer borrowed from the ER. The camera stabilizer is critical for a moving camera because After Effects' camera tracking functionality seems to get tripped up by a camera that wobbles.

Here's a small demo of what I was able to accomplish. There are some small flaws but the concept works as I intended. It was difficult to figure out how to do this and particularly tedious getting everything to line up correctly. Nevertheless, I am happy and will explore this further in the future.

Understanding Comics
====================

Scott McCloud’s book `Understanding Comics <https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Comics-Invisible-Scott-McCloud/dp/006097625X/>`_ is ostensibly a book about comic books as an art form, including its history, evolution, and modern structure.

The author has much love for comics and fell in love with them as a child. I can partially relate in that when I was younger I looked forward to the Sunday newspaper and reading the comics. However, I never had an affinity for comic books and found them to be a waste of time. These days I only read `Dilbert <http://dilbert.com/>`_ on a regular basis.

Nevertheless, I did enjoy this book. The book is about more than just comic books; it is about the visual dialogue of all art and storytelling. Although I don’t completely understand all of it, I can tell there is something important being communicated here that I need to understand. I’m looking forward to the class discussion to provide more context and re-reading the book again later to get a deeper understanding. What I want to do is to be able to understand what it is about successful art that makes it successful, and identify the specific mechanisms at work aiding art that resonates or appeals to me and others.

I particularly like Chapter 7, where McCloud identifies an artist’s path, starting with an Idea or Purpose and ending with the art’s Surface. I found this chapter to be thought provoking as it points out aspects of art that I am not aware of and am not able to channel in my own work.

On page 180, McCloud writes:

  This is the path of great storytellers, creators who have something to say through comics and devote all of their energies to controlling their medium, refining its ability to convey messages effectively.

In other words, starting with an idea or purpose and controlling the medium to express that idea or purpose. This is very different from art that starts with surface details and only demonstrates a mastery of the chosen tools and technology.

I want to understand the ideas in this book because I would like to do more than demonstrate a mastery of technology.
