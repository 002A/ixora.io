We completed our video teaching people how to make a laser cut box. I am quite pleased with the result.

I enjoyed our Video and Sound class a lot. I definitely got a lot more out of the experience than I thought I would. Most importantly, it has given me the confidence to actually use the video and sound equipment in the ER. Previously I was intimidated by the idea of using the cameras and afraid of breaking something. Now I see the amazing things that can be created with proper equipment and I will take the initiative to use it.

I also want to thank my fellow students, Caleb Ferguson and Yeonhee Lee. They are both talented and creative. We worked well together and I am happy to have been in a group with them. Their enthusiasm for this project means a lot.
