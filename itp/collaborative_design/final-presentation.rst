.. description: ITP class: Final Presentation
.. type: text

Today was the final day of our class. Our team presented the reLive business we developed over the course of the semester. The presentation included user personas, a UX design, a technical prototype, and a business model.

I'm proud of our team and how well we worked together. We all had other classes and responsibilities competing for our time but we all pitched in and worked when we could and we were forgiving when others couldn't. We had a good dynamic and were able to explore ideas effectively and efficiently.

The presentation is available `online <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10qQaOnN0DAVTBhCjgi0jkEF-CMMyMgQIovO7t7Xtu7g/edit?usp=sharing>`_.
