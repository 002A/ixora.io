.. description: ITP class: Readout, User Interviews, and Technology Research
.. type: text

Our second assignment for Collaborative Design is to complete a "Readout" for our project. We now have a name for our project and a brief elevator pitch. We also did a few user interviews and thought about the technology we might use to build a proof of concept.

Recap
=====

But before we get to that, let's recap our project use case and personas:

  I am going through life and I donâ€™t want to be burdened by documentation. I want to have the ability to re-live important and meaningful experiences without documentation tasks taking away from my ability to live in the moment.

And the personas for the use case:

Story Map
=========

Using this as a foundation, we brainstormed the story map for how this will all work. Again, our group used many postit-notes:

If you can't read that, here are the steps:

* Sign up

  * Create a private profile
* Initialize recording device

  * Get device. Connect existing profiles & download necessary apps.
  * Select which types of data I want to record
* LIVE LIFE

  * Walk outside and experience life
* Curate(d) memories

  * Approve of first pass
* Relive Past

  * Enjoy moments you've lived, feelings you've had, things you've enjoyed.
* Share

  * Share with close friends and family.
* Archive

  * PRESERVE FOREVER

Elevator Pitch
==============

Using the story map we developed a brief elevator pitch.

INSERT_ELEVATOR_PITCH

User Interviews
===============

We also did some user interviews. Here are the main points we learned:

* INSERT_POINT_1
* INSERT_POINT_2
* INSERT_POINT_3

Technology Research
===================

And finally, technology research.

The ideal solution would involve some kind of brain-computer connection whereby a computer could have direct access to how we experience the world, record the relevant experiences, and curate and filter them for us. There is some research being done to build these connections. The most well-known is Elon Musk's startup company `Neuralink <https://www.neuralink.com/>`_. It is unclear what kind of progress the company has made to date though.

There are scientific papers that show researchers that have been able to make tangible progress creating neural links. Consider the paper `Stable long-term chronic brain mapping at the single-neuron level <https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3969>`_. These researchers were able to inject electronics directly into the brains of mice and not adversely impact their lifespan. This show that they can both inject electronics though a needle without destroy it and the electronics can remain in place without being rejected by the host organism. Much more work needs to be done but this demonstrates the idea has potential.

A functioning brain-computer connection may be a reality one day but most likely it will be a long time before it becomes a stable consumer product. A more feasible product that can be built in the short term might be something that leverages the `Large-scale Image Memorability <http://memorability.csail.mit.edu/>`_ research project. This is a Neural Network that has been trained to estimate how memorable a photograph is. It is remarkable that this is possible. A device powered by this AI system could be connected to a user body-cam that sees all that the user sees. The AI can monitor the video feed and save photos it deems to be valuable.

We are eager to discuss this and get feedback tomorrow during class.
