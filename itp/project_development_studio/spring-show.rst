Using Python I created a tool to apply a Neural Style Transfer algorithm to Google Street View data to make an animation that looks like you are flying through a painting.

Google collects panorama photos from all around the world and makes them available through the Google Street View service. Although they visit many interesting locations, often the photos look dull. My project involves obtaining these photos through their API and using a coherent style transfer algorithm to make the sequence look like a painted animation.

Here are two examples:

Experimentation Tools
=====================

I did more than just make these two videos

Tools to do this again and again

Next Steps
