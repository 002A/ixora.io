.. type: text

Two weeks remaining in the class and I finally was able to make progress on writing my own style transfer code. I didn't write it from scratch, I rewrote the `existing code <https://github.com/cysmith/neural-style-tf>`_ I found online to improve the code quality and make it fit my workflow. I'm going to continue working to make further improvements over the next few days.

.. TEASER_END

Right now I can do a style transfer on a single image. I have some of the code written for videos. I'll finish that in the next day or two.

For now, here's a test. I converted this:

.. image:: /images/itp/project_development_studio/week11/idaho.jpg
  :width: 50%
  :align: center

To this:

.. image:: /images/itp/project_development_studio/week11/idaho_styled.jpg
  :width: 50%
  :align: center

I compared it to the existing code and my code gets the same results. Style transfers aren't that complicated once you get the hang of it.

It's critical I understand how this code works so I can write my own code to do style transfers for 360 video. I'll get there. Maybe not in the next two weeks, but I'll get there eventually.
