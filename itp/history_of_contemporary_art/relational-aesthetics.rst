Relational Aesthetics is a term coined by the curator Nicolas Bourriaud to describe art that rejects the manufacturing of traditional art objects and instead attempts to establish new human relationships through collective experiences and new interactions. The art puts the interaction at the center of the work instead of the artist or any physical manifestations of the artist's work.

As a member of a group I helped put together a presentation on Relational Aesthetics. You can find the presentation `here <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fLI5ANoaCDQA-NURzpMSU4EEYM1qT9IuEIkTBQOFkAw/edit?usp=sharing>`_.
