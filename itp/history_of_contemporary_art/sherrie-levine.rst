Sherrie Levine emerged as an important artist in the early 80's. She is famous for her Appropriation Art where she would take photographs of widely distributed photos made by famous male artists and present the work as her own, examining the concept of originality.

I created a short 10 minute presentation on Sherrie Levine to share with the class. It is available `here <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14jMHMupkGobT6pgO4ySR7aJhDkbPiwl3-bHZdRRCUJk/edit?usp=sharing>`_.
