.. type: text

The Woman's Building was a center for female education in the arts that operated from 1973 to 1991. The goal of the center was to develop new art practices and an artistic community that supported the needs of women.

  “It was an opportunity to be empowered. We could learn skills that we never learned before, and more important, that we could just create our place in the world, which is really what the Women’s Building represented. It’s a public center for women’s culture.  That we live in a world that is very male dominated, and the art world was certainly not serving us as women artists.
  We were very invisible and that we could carve out this little space that would be our space, and not just our space privately, but our space publicly. To say, ‘Here’s what we are making as women artists. Come see.’” - Cheri Gaulke

I created a short 10 minute presentation on the Woman's Building to share with the class. It is available `here <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13kJ3XQQCo8G67UBVlGoo6Xp9Vf5lF-JunIn_x9ZMwuc/edit?usp=sharing>`_.
