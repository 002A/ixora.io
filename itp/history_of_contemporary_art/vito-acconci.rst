Vito Acconci was a poet, performance artist, installation artist, designer, and literature editor. His work defies classification. In his words:

  If I specialize in a medium, I would be fixing a ground for myself, a ground I would have to be digging myself out of, constantly, as one medium was substituted for another - so, then, instead of turning toward “ground” I would shift my attention and turn to “instrument,” I would focus on myself as the instrument that acted on whatever ground was, from time to time, available.

I created a short 10 minute presentation on Vito Acconci to share with my class. It is available `here <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ERpjhWe3IaffO_1S1Fo_ZRbbqksIhtUN1RzXAc_UqKE/edit?usp=sharing>`_.
