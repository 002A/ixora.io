For the last class I prepared a short `presentation <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p43-ZXQzhv1T30P_GiEb-oyetTMFr0g-V1K2WfeALM8/edit?usp=sharing>`_ on Carrie Mae Weems. Weems is a African American photographer who addresses issues of sexism and racism with her work.

Pictured below is a selection of her work from `The Kitchen Table Series`, (1990). The series depicts staged scenes of a romance narrative.

This is the last meeting of my History of Contemporary Art class with Roselee Goldberg. Although I still one more paper to write, the class is drawing to a close. It's been immensely enjoyable and I am very glad I signed up for this. There's a lot to learn studying art.
