This week we learned about typography and how font choices contribute to our design decisions.

Expressive Words
----------------

Our first assignment is to create expressive words. Expressive words are representations of words that convey the meaning of the word through the fonts used to display the word.

My first word is opaque. The word is displayed in a bold black font with its antonyms layered behind it in semi-transparent colors.

  :align: center

.. TEASER_END

Next is the word `crenellated <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/crenellate>`_. This word came up in an `assignment <link://slug/introduction-to-rhino>`_ for my 3D printing class. It refers to the notches or spaces found along the top of a castle wall.

Finally, the word inconsistent. I did the best I could to make each letter completely different from the others.
