.. description: Visual Language Typography and Expression
.. type: text

This week we learned about typography and how font choices contribute to our design decisions. Fonts and typography contribute much to how well information is communicated to others.

I wanted to learn more about Adobe Illustrator so I went through some tutorials to get a basic understanding of the application, then dove in on these assignments.

Expressive Words
----------------

Our first assignment is to create expressive words. Expressive words are representations of words that convey the meaning of the word through the fonts used to display the word.

Using a thesaurus for ideas, I picked the word opaque. The word is displayed in a bold black font with its antonyms layered behind it in semi-transparent colors.

.. TEASER_END

Next is the word `crenellated <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/crenellate>`_. This word came up in an `assignment <link://slug/introduction-to-rhino>`_ for my 3D printing class. It refers to the notches or negative spaces found along the top of a castle wall.

Finally, the word inconsistent. I did the best I could to make each letter completely different from the others.

Redesigned Airline Ticket
-------------------------

Our second assignment is to redesign an airplane boarding bass. Airplane boarding passes are contain a lot of information intended for the passenger, flight crew, and TSA agents. The TSA agents and flight crew are trained to look for the items that are relevant for specific tasks but passengers are not. The boarding passes should be designed so that the most relevant information for passengers is most apparent. For passengers, getting to the correct gate on time is the most important issue. Information relevant to that goal is largest and at the top of the ticket.
