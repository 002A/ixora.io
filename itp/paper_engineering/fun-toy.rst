.. type: text

Our next assignment was to use what we learned in the first two classes to design and build a fun toy. I created a human face with moving eyes and mouth. The eyes can move side to side and the mouth can smile and sulk.

The eyes use a pull tab assembly with a brake and cuff to keep the eyes from moving too far to the right or left. The mouth uses a trap door to alternate between smiling or sulking.
