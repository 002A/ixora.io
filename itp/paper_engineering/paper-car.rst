Tomorrow we are going to visit a school to share our work. Our goal was to make a paper toy kit to share with the students. We need to bring one fully assembled and one ready to be assembled by the children.

After much thought, I made this paper car:

The tabs and slots holding it together are designed to be linked on the inside where they can't be seen. I designed this in Illustrator after making some prototypes by hand.

I printed it out on heavy cardstock paper and cut it out with an exacto knife. I wish I had a `Cricut machine <https://shop.cricut.com/en_us/machines.html>`_ to do the cutting for me; it would have saved me a lot of time.

The tabs and slots are a bit small and are prone to tearing. In retrospect, I should have made them bigger and more durable. On the other hand, humans with much smaller hands might have an easier time putting this together than I did.
