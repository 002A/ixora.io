For our final project we need to design and build something to present in the next and final class. This is a half semester class so the final project is due the same time as other midterms.

I'm interested in origami and want to learn how to fold interesting designs. For the final I am going to design my own origami model, document it, and present it next week.

To prepare for this I need to get a lot better at folding origami. I started by following Youtube tutorials. My first was a `crane <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyC7pkT-dE0>`_:

Next, a `butterfly <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWppAdgvEtI>`_:

Then I got more ambitious, folding a `frog <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RglWokK1ZNU>`_.

This `Double Spearhead Tessellation <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXDEleyeOlg>`_ was challenging but achievable. I wish I picked a different color paper.

This `Flower X <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVtTs-kycFA>`_ was fun to fold:

I was feeling pretty confident so I took a stab at the models in Robert Lang's book `Origami Design Secrets <https://www.amazon.com/Origami-Design-Secrets-Mathematical-Methods/dp/1568814364/>`_. That's when it stopped going so well. This ruby-throated hummingbird was extremely challenging. I persevered and made it through most of the 41 steps but couldn't get the head right. It looks OK from the angle photographed below but the model isn't complete. You will also notice the paper on the head area is starting to tear.

This is one of the easier models in his book. I am going to have to practice more before trying again. The more complicated models have ambiguous and curved folds that are confusing to follow.

Happily I was able to fold Lang's stealth fighter model.

For the final project Sam would like me to design my own model and write documentation suitable for a origami beginner. He'd rather see a simpler model that is documented well than for me to fold one of the complicated models from Lang's book. That plan works for me and matches my origami skill level. I am still going to explore Lang's book but I will also use other resources available to me.
