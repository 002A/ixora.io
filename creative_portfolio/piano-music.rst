I love playing the piano.

It was always my dream to buy a piano and learn to play music on it. A few years ago I made that dream a reality after making room for it in my small apartment. Now I play every day. It makes me very happy.

Here are some videos of me playing a few songs.

*Frederic Chopin's Prelude in C Minor #20*, also known as the *Funeral Prelude*.

*Erik Satie - Gnossienne #3*. Satie is my favorite composer. I can play the first four Gnossiennes and the Gymnopedies.

*Pachelbel's Canon in D*. I played this song at my brother's wedding in October.
